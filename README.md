This is a minesweeper project. The currently functionalities is that it allows you to:

1) start a game where bombs are placed after your first click to ensure that a flood fill is always instantiated.

2) It also allows you to show the bombs after the start of a game, but doing so will not allow you to win.

3) Allows you to validate whether or not you have won based on the the amount of squares that are visible and if they are not bombs!

In order to run the project just run `npm install` then `npm run start`.
